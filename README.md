# CBCTrendAnalysis
This is the official repo for the standard analysis of Audubon Christmas Bird Count data. The goal of the analysis is to produce annual abundance indices and temporal trends in those indices for more than 500 bird species that winter in Canada and the continental USA.

Abundance indices and trends are estimated for spatial units (analytical strata) that are intersections of province, state, and Bird Conservation Region (BCR) using the spatial first-difference model described in Smith et al. (2024). Abundance indices are then aggregated to larger areas and trends are estimated per province, state, BCR, country, and for the entire survey area.
